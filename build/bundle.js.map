Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\r\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\r\n *\r\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\r\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\r\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\r\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\r\n *\r\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\r\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\r\n *\r\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\r\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\r\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\r\n *\r\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\r\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\r\n */\r\nvar List = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    tslib_1.__extends(List, _super);\r\n    function List(props) {\r\n        var _this = _super.call(this, props) || this;\r\n        _this._root = Utilities_1.createRef();\r\n        _this._surface = Utilities_1.createRef();\r\n        _this._onRenderPage = function (pageProps, defaultRender) {\r\n            var _a = _this.props, onRenderCell = _a.onRenderCell, role = _a.role;\r\n            var _b = pageProps.page, items = _b.items, startIndex = _b.startIndex, divProps = tslib_1.__rest(pageProps, [\"page\"]);\r\n            // only assign list item role if no role is assigned\r\n            var cellRole = (role === undefined) ?

Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\r\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\r\n *\r\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\r\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\r\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\r\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\r\n *\r\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\r\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\r\n *\r\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\r\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\r\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\r\n *\r\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\r\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\r\n */\r\nvar List = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    tslib_1.__extends(List, _super);\r\n    function List(props) {\r\n        var _this = _super.call(this, props) || this;\r\n        _this._root = Utilities_1.createRef();\r\n        _this._surface = Utilities_1.createRef();\r\n        _this._onRenderPage = function (pageProps, defaultRender) {\r\n            var _a = _this.props, onRenderCell = _a.onRenderCell, role = _a.role;\r\n            var _b = pageProps.page, items = _b.items, startIndex = _b.startIndex, divProps = tslib_1.__rest(pageProps, [\"page\"]);\r\n            // only assign list item role if no role is assigned\r\n            var cellRole = (role === undefined) ?
